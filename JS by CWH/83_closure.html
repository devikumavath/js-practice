  <h1>closures in js</h1>
  <p>
    A closure is the combination of a function bundled together (enclosed) with
    references to its surrounding state (the lexical environment). In other
    words, a closure gives you access to an outer function's scope from an inner
    function. In JavaScript, closures are created every time a function is
    created, at function creation time.

  <body>
    <script>
   function init() {
  var name = "Mozilla"; // name is a local variable created by init
  function displayName() {
    // displayName() is the inner function, that forms the closure
    console.log(name); // use variable declared in the parent function
  }
  name = "devi"
  displayName();
}
init();

    </script>
  </body>
